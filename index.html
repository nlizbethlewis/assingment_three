<p class="intro">Kelly Thomas, 27, opened a Bank of America checking account in high school because it was the most accessible bank in her neighborhood in New Jersey. But after she graduated from New York University in 2011, her decision to use Bank of America started to seem like a big mistake.

<p>Thomas took a part-time job teaching theater to middle school students, bringing home only $100 a week. To stay on top of her bills, including monthly student loan payments, she relied on Bank of America's automatic debits. Over time, those auto debits consumed her meager paycheck and more.</p> 

<p>While Thomas knew she needed to bring in more income to cover her expenses, she partially blamed Bank of America's insufficient funds policy. Instead of declining purchases when she did not have the money in her account, Bank of America approved the transactions and charged hefty overdraft fees -- $35 for every transaction. The result was a bank account that functioned like a costly line of credit, something Thomas had not signed up for. 

<p>"I had no system in place for managing money," she admits, "and there were hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. Every few months I would overdraft -- just by mistake -- by oblivious spending. It's not like I was living lavishly. I spent money on food, the train, copays on medical bills."</p>

<p>Eventually, she found out other banks don't charge as much. She now has an account at TD Bank, where the minimum balances and fees are lower.</p>

<p>Thomas is not alone in her banking struggles. In 2011, Bank of America was ordered to pay $410 million in a settlement for a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit focused on the company’s policy of posting debit card transactions so that the biggest transaction would post first rather than in the order the transactions were made.<p>

<p>In a further downside for customers, overall bank fees are on the rise. <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/checking/record-setting-year-for-checking-account-fees-1.aspx">Bankrate's 2015 Checking Survey</a> found that account holders are paying record-high fees for ATM withdrawals outside their bank's network and for overdraft fees, and they are facing increasingly higher fee-free minimum balances. The report found the average monthly maintenance fee rose 11 percent in 2015, to a new high of $5.86. These banking policies are particularly troubling for low-income earners and retirees. </p>
 
<p>The best way to find a bank that is suitable for your income is to shop around. If you have a lot of money saved, you could benefit from the perks of an account at a national bank. Without the extra monetary cushion in savings, a community bank usually offers better balance requirements and lower fees. And if you can qualify for an account at a credit union, you might be able to eliminate fees altogether. </p>
 
<p>To find out which type of bank is right for you, check out this calculator to see how much it would cost you per year to bank at four types of institutions: national corporate banks, community banks, credit unions, and check-cashing facilities.</p>
