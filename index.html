	 <h1>What Type of Bank Is Most Affordable for You?</h1>

<div id="body">
 
<p>Kelly Thomas, 27, opened a Bank of America checking account in high school because it was the most acessible bank in her neighborhood in New Jersey. In high school, without the expenses of adult life, Thomas was satisfied with her bank. After she graduated from New York University in 2011, her decision to use Bank of America started to seem like a big mistake.

<p>Straight out of college, Thomas took a part-time job teaching theater to middle school students, bringing home only $100 a week. To stay on top of her bills, including monthly student loan payments, she relied on Bank of America's automatic debits. Over time, those autodebits consumed her meager paycheck and more.</p> 
 
<p>"I had no system in place for managing money," she admits, "and there were hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. Every few months I would overdraft -- just by mistake -- by oblivious spending. It's not like I was living lavishly. I spent money on food, the train, copays on medical bills."</p>
 
<p>While Thomas knew she needed to bring in more income to cover her expenses, she partially blamed Bank of America's insufficient funds policy. Instead of declining purchases when she did not have the money in her account, Bank of America approved the transactions and charged hefty overdraft fees. Thirty-five dollars for every transaction. The result was a bank account that functioned like a costly line of credit. 

"That's not what I signed up for. I don't have a credit card so I can't spend money I don't have. But it just lets you keep spending and doesn't stop you," said Thomas. "It was just terrible. My friends call Bank of America 'Thief of America.'"</p>

<p>Three years ago Thomas closed her account. But, before she could cut ties with Bank of America, she had to get out of the red. 

<p>"I had to leave my debit card at home, and just work, and scrimp," said Thomas.</p>

<p>Eventually, she found out other banks don't charge as much. She now has an account at TD Bank, where the minimum balances and fees are lower.</p>
 
<p>Thomas is not alone in her banking struggles. In 2011, Bank of America was ordered to pay $410 million in a settlement for a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit focused on Bank of America's policy of posting debit card transations so that the biggest transaction posts first, rather than in the order it was spent. 

<p>Bank of America isn't the only Bank with costly fees and policies. <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/checking/record-setting-year-for-checking-account-fees-1.aspx">Bankrate's 2015 Checking Survey</a> found that account holders are paying record-high fees for ATM withdrawals outside their bank's network, overdraft fees, and increasingly higher fee-free minimum balances. These banking policies are particularly taxing on low-income earners and retirees. The report found the average monthly maintenance fee rose 11 percent in 2015, to a new high of $5.86.</p>
 
<p>The best way to find a bank that is suitable for your income is to shop around. If you have a lot of money saved, you could benefit from the perks of an account at a national bank. Without the extra monetary cushion in savings, a community bank usually offers better balance requirements and lower fees. And if you can qualify for an account at a credit union, you might be able to eliminate fees altogether. </p>
 
<p>To find out which banking facility is right for you, check out this calculator to see how much it would cost you per year to bank at three types of institutions: national corporate banks, community banks, credit unions.</p>
